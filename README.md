CSS files are in `src/`, use `build.py` to concatenate and minify the files to `dist.css`

See `build.py` for the order of concatenation and a brief description of each file.


**Trial CSS**

`trial2.css` and `trial3.css` are appended to dist.css to create `dist-trial-2.css` and `dist-trial-3.css` respectively.
